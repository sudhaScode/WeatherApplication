## Managed Dynamic array for pagenation algorithm

## if you have a asynchronous function outside, and calling inside useEffect whose callback also async throughs critical error, so must be keep normal callback function if you have external fecth function.

## If you need to utilize state for fecthing or any other implementation, call those operation inside side effect handler i.e useEffect with dependency array element with that state.

## Don't worry about state updation when using state management with context provider to the components. The time when it comes to use the state directly get it from context. surely the state gets updated before you using it.
